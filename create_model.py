# Larger variants of EfficientNet do not guarantee improved performance, especially for tasks with less data or fewer classes. In such a case, the larger variant of EfficientNet chosen, the harder it is to tune hyperparameters.
# TODO: use small variant of EfficientNet
# TODO: reprogram efficient net example

# TODO: try ranger as optimizer in keras example
# TODO: change code to regression and custom dataset
# TODO: use latest weights https://keras.io/examples/vision/image_classification_efficientnet_fine_tuning/#using-the-latest-efficientnet-weights
